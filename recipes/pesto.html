<p>An authentic Genoese pesto. It's straight from Italy and you won't find a better recipe! This calls for a spoonful of pecorino cheese, but you could also use all Parmesan in a pinch. To store in fridge for up to 1 month: place pesto in a jar, cover with olive oil, and top with a lid.</p>

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons grated pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>

<strong>Steps:</strong>

<ol>
    <li>Crush garlic using a mortar and pestle. Add pine nuts; crush with the garlic. Add basil leaves gradually, making circular movements with the pestle, until a smooth paste forms.</li>
    <li>Mix Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and pecorino Romano cheese using a wooden spoon. Stir in olive oil until pesto is blended.</li>
